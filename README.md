# simpleui_desktop
Basic SimpleUI client for desktop devices (Raspberry, Linux, Windows etc.). This client reads and executes the JSON Simple UI configuration. Required settings for web server ( configuration provider)

Uses the generic JSON configuration format, but only basic functionality is supported as most Android functionality is specific to Android SDK only

To work, you need to specify in the settings the parameters for accessing the web server, for example http://192.168.1.143:2312/ui2/hs/simplewms, code 20
